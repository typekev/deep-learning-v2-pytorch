    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n",

    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg)."

    "1. An [embedding layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#embedding) that converts our word tokens (integers) into embeddings of a specific size.\n",
    "2. An [LSTM layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm) defined by a hidden_state size and number of layers\n",

    "We need to add an [embedding layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#embedding) because there are 74000+ words in our vocabulary. It is massively inefficient to one-hot encode that many classes. So, instead of one-hot encoding, we can have an embedding layer and use that layer as a lookup table. You could train an embedding layer using Word2Vec, then load it here. But, it's fine to just make a new layer, using it for only dimensionality reduction, and let the network learn the weights.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you're network will have better performance with more layers; between 2-3. Adding more layers allows the network to learn really complex relationships. \n",

    "> **Exercise:** Complete the `__init__`, `forward`, and `init_hidden` functions for the SentimentRNN model class.\n",
